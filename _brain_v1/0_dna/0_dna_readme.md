### The Genetic Code

This folder contains the **Constitution** of the brain.

- **Setup**: How to clone and initialize.
- **Growth**: How to add new synapses (genetic mutations).
- **Structure**: @_brain_v1/0_dna/synapses/

### Evolution Strategy
The brain is designed to evolve. v1 is just the first iteration. As the project matures, synapses should be added, deprecated, or mutated.
