### The Genetic Code

This folder contains the **Constitution** of the brain.

- **Setup**: How to clone and initialize.
- **Growth**: How to add new genes (DNA) and synapses (memory mutations).
- **Structure**: Shipped genes live directly in `@_brain_v1/0_dna/` as `_gene_*.md` (user genes use `gene_*.md`).

### Evolution Strategy
The brain is designed to evolve. v1 is just the first iteration. As the project matures, synapses should be added, deprecated, or mutated.
