# Gene 2: Metabolic Efficiency (Token Budget)

## Biological principle
The `_brain` must not consume more energy than the body it governs. It is a thin control layer, not a second codebase. Complexity is a toxin.

## Operational constraints
- Agents must never use “read all files” as a strategy to find context.
- Mandatory ingestion must stay explicit and minimal (entry gates only).
- If a file’s name (slug) does not provide enough signal to justify opening it, the file is named incorrectly.
