# Current measured state (biomarkers / telemetry) for the Brain layer.
# Machine-managed snapshot.
#
# Rules:
# - Do not edit manually unless a protocol explicitly instructs it.
# - Update only after running a WBC scan.
#
# Scope note:
# - This file describes the state of `_brain_v1` (the Brain layer), not the host repo codebase.
