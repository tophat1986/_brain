# Moral Alignment Check

Before planning or coding, run this check in one pass:

1. Restate the user goal in one sentence.
2. State the non-goal(s) and forbidden change areas.
3. State expected blast radius (files/systems touched).
4. Confirm reversibility (can this be rolled back cleanly?).

If any item is unknown, ask one focused clarifying question before implementation.
